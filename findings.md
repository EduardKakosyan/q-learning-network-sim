The simulations completed successfully. Let me analyze the results for each topology:

Small Network (4 nodes, 4 excess edges):
All algorithms performed well with no packet loss
Dijkstra had lowest delay (0.0325s)
Q-Learning achieved highest throughput (1876 packets)
Perfect fairness index (1.0) for all algorithms


Medium Network (8 nodes, 10 excess edges):
No packet loss for any algorithm
Dijkstra had best delay (0.0694s)
LCF had highest delay (0.2348s)
Q-Learning performed between Dijkstra and LCF:
Delay: 0.0901s (30% higher than Dijkstra but much better than LCF)
Throughput: 5578 packets (close to Dijkstra's 5609)
Good fairness (0.9986)


Large Network (12 nodes, 15 excess edges):
Most interesting results:
Dijkstra: Best delay (0.0625s), highest throughput (7428 packets)
LCF: Struggled with high delay (1.0935s) and some packet loss
Q-Learning: Good balance
Delay: 0.0838s (34% higher than Dijkstra but much better than LCF)
No packet loss (unlike LCF)
Good throughput (7334 packets)
Maintained fairness (0.9972)


Key Findings:
Q-Learning Performance:
Learns effective routing strategies
Balances between delay and throughput
Avoids packet loss even in larger networks
Maintains high fairness across all scenarios
Comparison with Traditional Algorithms:
Dijkstra: Consistently good performance, especially for delay
LCF: Struggles with larger networks, leading to high delays and some packet loss
Q-Learning: Robust performance across different network sizes
Scalability:
Q-Learning maintains good performance as network size increases
Particularly shines in the large network where LCF struggles
Delay increase with network size is reasonable

# Next set of changes
Added three new network topologies:
1. Bottleneck Network: Two densely connected clusters with limited connections between them
- Ring with Cross-Connections: Ring topology with additional shortcuts
- Scale-Free Network: Power-law degree distribution with hub nodes
2. Enhanced Q-Learning parameters for complex environments:
- Increased learning rate (0.15) for faster adaptation
- Maintained high discount factor (0.99) for long-term planning
- Higher exploration rate (0.25) for better topology discovery
- More state bins (6) for finer granularity
3. Added topology-specific features:
- Higher link capacities for hub nodes in scale-free networks
- More bursty traffic patterns in bottleneck topology
- Longer simulation duration (60s) for better learning
